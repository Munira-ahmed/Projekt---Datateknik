<Flappy Bird>
Description:
This is a mini project where my partner and I were making a simpler version of Flappy Bird. Random obstacles appear on the display and the user can avoid them.
EQUIPMENT:
The code was designed to run on a ChipKIT Uno32 together with a ChipKIT Basic I/O that has a display board where the game can be shown.
HOW TO RUN:
Run in msys2 mingw64 terminal:
(Go to the mini-project folder)
. /opt/mcb32tools/environment
 make
 make install TTYDEV=/dev/ttyS2 (The serial port differs. ttyS0...ttyS5 in windows)
